# Arabic News Classifier

This project is an **Arabic News Classifier** that leverages various machine learning algorithms to classify Arabic news articles into different categories. It provides implementations using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **XGBoost** for the classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a reliable and efficient classifier capable of understanding and categorizing Arabic news content. The project consists of several components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the text data for classification.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various algorithms to train the classifier.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models on test data.


## Usage

- To train and classify news articles using a specific model, navigate to the corresponding directory (CNN, KNN, or XGBoost) and run the respective training or classification script.
- Training python scripts most be run before classification


## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of the evaluation are included in the respective training scripts.

## Future Work

- Improve the preprocessing steps for better text representation.
- Experiment with more advanced models like Transformers.
- Enhance the GUI for a better user experience.
- Incorporate user feedback to continuously improve model accuracy.
## This project is currently being restructured and a new frontend is being developed
