# Arabic News Classifier

This project is an **Arabic News Classifier** that leverages various machine learning algorithms to categorize Arabic news articles. It uses the **SANAD Dataset** from Kaggle as the primary dataset and provides implementations using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **XGBoost** for classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a reliable and efficient classifier capable of understanding and categorizing Arabic news content. The project consists of several components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the text data for classification.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various algorithms to train the classifier.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models on test data.

## Usage

- To train and classify news articles using a specific model, navigate to the corresponding directory (CNN, KNN, or XGBoost) and run the respective training or classification script.
- Ensure that training scripts are run before classification.

## Results

Each model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed evaluation results are provided in the respective training scripts.

## Future Work

- Improve preprocessing steps for better text representation.
- Experiment with advanced models like Transformers.
- Enhance the GUI for a more user-friendly experience.
- Incorporate user feedback to continuously improve model accuracy.

## Ongoing Development

This project is currently undergoing restructuring, and a new frontend web application is being developed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the classifier.
